"# twitteratti" 
This is a bootcamp learning project I built in my internship. It is now live at https://floating-sea-80765.herokuapp.com/  hosted on heroku. 
In this social media clone, I have tried to build twitter like functionality. 
-> register and login
-> make profile
-> add a post
-> add a comment on a post
-> like a post
-> follow someone or unfollow someone (although it woudn't affect the feed in the post, this feature may be added in future)
-> check out other users' profile
-> Delete your account permanently.

Thanks for checking out my work. Thanks to udemy course I followed as this is the forst MERN stack based website I built. Additional features have been implemented based on learning. :)
